Steps to setting up a branch

git branch foo
	Make a new branch with a name foo

git branch foo v2.6.34 
	Have the branch "foo" point to where the "v2.6.34" tag is pointing

git checkout foo
	Check out where v2.6.34 is pointing
__________________________
Pushing/Pulling to a branch

git pull [main] [branch]
	EX: git pull git@github.com:aweeks/linux-2.6 project3

You can skip this and use "git pull/push" by adding the following to the config file.  
Sample case is Assignment 3

	[branch "project3"]
		remote = origin
		merge = refs/heads/project3

	[remote "origin"]
		fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
		url = git@github.com:aweeks/linux-2.6.git
___________________________
Check out a branch (after you added the repsitory)

	git checkout -b origin/project3
